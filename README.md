## Project Description
A C# console simulation where emergency units (Police, Firefighters, Ambulances) respond to random incidents across a city.  
The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

---

## Features
- Randomly generated incidents (Fire, Crime, Medical)
- Automatic emergency unit selection
- Incident difficulty displayed (Easy, Medium, Difficult)
- Fixed scoring system (+10 for correct response, -5 for no response)
- 5 simulation rounds

---

## Technologies Used
- C# (.NET)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Console Application

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# editor.
2. Build and run the program.
3. Follow the console instructions through 5 simulation rounds.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more unit types (e.g., SWAT, Rescue Teams)
- Manual unit selection
- More complex scoring based on difficulty or response time
